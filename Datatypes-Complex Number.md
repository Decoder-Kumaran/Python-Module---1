# PYTHON MODULE -1
# (D) ðŸ§® Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim:
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm:
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

## ðŸ’» Program:

a=int(input()) # the real part of the complex number

b=int(input()) # the imaginary part of the complex number

x=complex(a,b) #assigning complex number to x using complex()

print(x) # print x

print(type(x)) # to print type of x

## Output:

## Result:
Thus, The Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts is verified.
